# pycharm_bracket_fix
Quick and dirty fix for the PyCharm brackets problem 
described in 

https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/PY-35001

Currently some Windows users can't use brackets like [] and {}.

Since it's still possible to paste them via the clipboard,
this script for Autohotkey does this.

## Installation

Download & install Autohotkey from 
https://www.autohotkey.com/

Double click on pycharm_bracket_fix.ahk

In windows that have a have ending with "- PyCharm" the brackets are now entered via the clipboard.

Try slowly!
